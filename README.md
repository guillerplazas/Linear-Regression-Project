# Linear-Regression-Project
Project done in Numerical Calculus. It studies the correlation of data between the life expectancy and the number of babies per Woman from a large database using linear regression.

It makes linear regressions for each decade, that is, when are comparing 2 variables x and
y in a particular decade, we use all the approximately 1500 pairs (x, y) to adjust a model of
the form y = ax + b.


The output of the program shows the completion of the following tasks:</br>
* a) The names of the 2 variables you are comparing x and y from the database
* b) for each decade: the parameters a and b for the model of the form y = ax + b, the total error
e, the country C and Y within that decade where the worst error for the model happened
* c) the parameters (c<sub>0</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>3</sub>, c<sub>4</sub>, c<sub>5</sub>) that best adjust the model
a<sub>t</sub> = c<sub>0</sub> + c<sub>t</sub> ; b<sub>t</sub> = c<sub>2</sub> + c<sub>3</sub>t ; e<sub>t</sub> = c<sub>4</sub> + c<sub>5</sub>t.

It also answers following questions:
* Are data becoming more or less difficult to explain with linear regression? What does suggest in terms of these variables?
* For each decade, take a look at the country C and year Y , where the worst error happened.
Did any reason influence that country in that period of time to make it an exception?
